# ðŸ“– Background
When a user visits a website, the website makes request(s) to the server to view the website. We will call the server as Back-end and the websites as Front-end. The front-end awaits till any response is received from the back-end. When the back-end sends any response, it uses certain codes to tell the front-end whether requests were fulfilled or not. If the requests were not fulfilled, then why it was fulfilled. These status codes are called 'HTTP Status' codes.

The **HTTP Status** codes are divided into 5 categories. The five categories are :

1. Informational responses (100 â€“ 199)
2. Successful responses (200 â€“ 299)
3. Redirection messages (300 â€“ 399)
4. Client error responses (400 â€“ 499)
5. Server error responses (500 â€“ 599)
